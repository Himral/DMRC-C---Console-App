This is a C++ implementation of a Metro Guide System. The system helps users find the shortest path or a path with minimum interchanges between two metro stations in a fictional metro network.

## Features

- Find the shortest path between two metro stations
- Find a path with minimum interchanges between two metro stations
- Display a list of all metro stations along with interchanges
